Battleships - Backend
=======================

## Synopsis

Battleship is a guessing game for two players. Each player sets a fleet of ships of varying sizes on a 10 X 10 grid. Players take turns shooting (guessing) at each others boards. When a player sinks all the ships in their opponents fleet, THEY WIN!

## Technologies Used

- RUBY
- RSPEC

## Context

Week 2 Project at Makers Academy

## Collaborators
This week I worked with the ever patient Marcus de Wilde. Although we made great progress in the first 2 days, we got slightly carried away conceptualizing the Board class and ended the week with all kinds of boards and no players (oooops!).

## Still to complete/refactor

- give ships name attribute if Ship class
- add Player class
- add Cell class
- add Game class
- get board working as boardless board

## Reflections

This project was a personal low for me so far at Makers Academy. Although both Marcus and I had more than the necessary skills to complete this level of project, we struggled at the design level and finished the week with bruised egos and very little code to show for it. 

Long story short, Marcus and I struggled with design decisions, which led us to design the Board class in two different ways (once with and once without a grid system). This laborious process (officially called 'Crashing and Burning') taught me that there are many different ways to get things done in OOO Design and no single way is necessarily 'better' than any other way. I think experimenting with these different options, instead of sticking to a single decision and blasting on to complete the project, will hopefully help me to be a better designer in the future. 

Pair programming on this project was particularily difficult. Marcus and I managed to keep it together and work more-or-less efficiently while the going was good, but our relationship all but broke down when the going got tough. Personally, I found it difficult to deal with the compounding levels of faillure and guilt that this kind of wreck can put upon a small team of relative strangers. I obviously felt guilty for letting myself down, but more importantly, I felt guilty for letting my partner down. 

As the project got more off course, I felt personally responsible for guiding us back to shore. The harder I tried to fix the problems, both in our code and in our deteriorating working relationship, the more dust I kicked up and the harder it was for us to see the solutions. My number one takeaway from this pair programing experience is that sometimes you've got to take a step back and let the code burn. Try your best not to let your self-worth and your working relationships burn with it. 


Note: All Battleship puns intended.
