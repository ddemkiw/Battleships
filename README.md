Battleships - Backend
=======================

## Synopsis

Battleship is a guessing game for two players. Each player sets a fleet of ships of varying sizes on a 10 X 10 grid. Players take turns shooting (guessing) at each others boards. When a player sinks all the ships in their opponents fleet, THEY WIN!

## Technologies Used

- RUBY
- RSPEC

## Context

Week 2 Project at Makers Academy

## Collaborators
This week I worked with the ever patient Marcus de Wilde. Although we made great progress in the first 2 days, we got slightly carried away conceptualizing the Board class and ended the week with all kinds of boards and no players (oooops!).

## Still to complete/refactor

- give ships name attribute if Ship class
- add Player class
- add Cell class
- add Game class
- get board working as boardless board
